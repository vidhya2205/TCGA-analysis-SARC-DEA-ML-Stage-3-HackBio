# Supplementary Information

1. ## **Patient Demographics**

The Supplementary figure 1 illustrates the differences in demographics (sarcoma subtypes, gender) between the two age groups compared in the study. There is a uneven distribution of the patient's primary diagnosis (subtypes) and gender as well. 

The OA (>=40 age group) includes Dedifferentiated liposarcoma(4 samples), Fibromyxosarcoma(3 samples), Leiomyosarcoma, NOS (8 samples), Undifferentiated sarcoma( 5 samples), with over 2:3 female: male ratio.

The AYA (18-40 age group) includes  Aggressive fibromatosis(1 sample), Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (3 samples), Leiomyosarcoma, NOS (4 samples),Liposarcoma, well differentiated(1 sample), Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor(5 samples), Synovial sarcoma, biphasic (1 sample), Synovial sarcoma, NOS(2 samples) and Synovial sarcoma, spindle cell (3 samples)subtypes, with 3:2 female: male ratio.

2. ## **Comparison of significant genes identified by ML model and DGEA**

Supplementary figure 2 indicates the difference between the significant genes identified by the ML model and DGEA. Its seen that the significant genes identified by ML model fall under the nonsignificant category by DGEA and stringent cutoff of log fold change(logFC) threshold of ±1.5  and FDR < 0.005.
