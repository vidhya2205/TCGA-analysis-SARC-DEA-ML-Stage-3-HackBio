# Supplementary Information

1. ## **Patient Demographics**

The Supplementary figure 1 illustrates the differences in demographics (sarcoma subtypes, gender) between the two age groups compared in the study. There is a uneven distribution of the patient's primary diagnosis (subtypes) and gender as well. 

The OA (>=40 age group) includes Dedifferentiated liposarcoma(4 samples), Fibromyxosarcoma(3 samples), Leiomyosarcoma, NOS (8 samples), Undifferentiated sarcoma( 5 samples), with over 2:3 female: male ratio.

The AYA (18-40 age group) includes  Aggressive fibromatosis(1 sample), Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (3 samples), Leiomyosarcoma, NOS (4 samples),Liposarcoma, well differentiated(1 sample), Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor(5 samples), Synovial sarcoma, biphasic (1 sample), Synovial sarcoma, NOS(2 samples) and Synovial sarcoma, spindle cell (3 samples)subtypes, with 3:2 female: male ratio.

2. ## **Comparison of significant genes identified by ML model and DGEA**

Supplementary figure 2 indicates the difference between the significant genes identified by the ML model and DGEA. Its seen that the significant genes identified by ML model fall under the nonsignificant category by DGEA and stringent cutoff of log fold change(logFC) threshold of ±1.5  and FDR < 0.005. This may be due to the use of SD values for feature selection. The results may differ for other feature selection methods like Boruta and RFE.

  3. ## **Visual Representation of the biomarker findings**

The ML model, DGEA and FEA has identified a set of significant dysregulated genes which have some established role in cancer. Significant biomarkers and their associated pathways in AYA and OA patient groups are illustrated in supplementary figure 3.
